# Why

* Why do this?
  * visualization
  * avoiding the curse of dimensionality
  * avoiding overfitting and improving the generalization ability
  * shortening training time and improving computation efficiency
  * the key for machine learning project(bad/good or failure/success)  
* Why can do this?
  * The data contains many features that are either redundant or irrelevant.
* How do this?
  * Feature Selection
  * Feature Extraction
