**The goal of this project is to summarize the various experiences in the neural network training process. When we train the network, we always have to face two major problems. One is the design of the network structure, and the other is the training configuration of the network, which is hyperparameter tuning**

# Why

* Why do this?
  * the key for machine learning project(bad/good or failure/success)
  * avoiding overfitting and improving the generalization ability
  * shortening training time and improving computation efficiency
  * avoiding the curse of dimensionality
  * visualization
* Why can do this?
  * The data contains many features that are either redundant or irrelevant.
* How do this?
  * Feature Selection
  * Feature Extraction
